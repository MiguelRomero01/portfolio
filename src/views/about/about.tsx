					Hi, I'm Miguel Romero, a 19-year-old software engineering student. Throughout my studies,
					I've worked on multiple projects that have allowed me to deepen my understanding of
					technologies, software architecture, and teamwork. <br />
					<br /> I hold certifications in Python, JavaScript, and Data Analysis, and I'm passionate
					about learning, collaborating in teams, and developing innovative solutions. These three
					qualities have shaped my discipline and problem-solving abilities. <br />
					<br />
					In team projects, Iâ€™m often chosen as the leader because of my decision-making skills and
					my ability to delegate tasks effectively. My teammates appreciate my structured approach
					to project management and my focus on achieving the best results together.
